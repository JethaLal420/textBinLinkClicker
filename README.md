Paste code and *save* it.

Everytime textbin link is opened this script will run.

###USE CASE:
- This script will click first link from text until it redirects to some other website.
- If redirected domain is crptobin, it will copy password from textbin website (if available with same format) and paste in input box, unbin and click the first link in unbinned text seperated by '-'.


**Note:** In future, if domain name is not the same. Modify @match link.
